# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# Example:
# Given a binary tree
#           1
#          / \
#         2   3
#        / \     
#       4   5    
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

# Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        longest_path = 0
        def longest(node):
            if node is None:
                return -1
            nonlocal longest_path
            left = longest(node.left)
            right = longest(node.right)
            longest_path = max(left+right+2,longest_path)
            return max(left,right)+1
        longest(root)
        return longest_path
